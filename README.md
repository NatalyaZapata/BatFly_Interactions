## Functionality and origin

The data and code provided here aim at making reproducible the graphical and numerical analyses presented in our data paper.

## List of folders and files

1.  code (folder) -\> Contains the R scripts to plot the figures.

2.  data (folder) -\> Contains the files used to plot the figures in addition to the original data files of our data paper.

3.  figures (folder) -\> Contains the exported figures.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `BatFly_Interactions.Rproj` project file.
2.  In the folder `code`, open the scripts `Figure 1.R`, `Figure 2.R`,`Figure 3.R` to recreate the figures published in our data paper.

## Acknowledgments

We are immensely grateful to all researchers who collected primary data in the field and published their records, as without them it would be impossible to compile the BatFly database. Naturalistic studies are vital to Biology and, thus, should be properly funded and praised. In addition, we thank Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, for the work infrastructure and Consejo Comunitario del Alto y Medio Dagua (CC-AMDA), Colombia, and Instituto de Ecología (INECOL), Mexico, for allowing us to access their localities. We also thank other institutions, especially Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, which provided us with work infrastructure during short research stays. This study was financed by Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia (MinCiencias, Convocatoria Doctorados en el Exterior 860) and the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES, 88887.388097/2019-00 and 88887.467879/2019-00). GG was funded by National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq# 308119/2022-3). MARM was funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH, 3.2-BRA/1134644 and 3.4--1134644--BRA-GA), National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, 304498/2019-0), São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, 2018/20695-7), and Dean of Research of the University of São Paulo (PRP-USP, 18.1.660.41.7). Last, but not least, we thank the [Stack Overflow community](https://stackoverflow.com), where we solve most of our coding dilemmas.
